# AOW Visual Assets

This directory contains visual assets for the AOW project, including architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrative images.

## File Descriptions

### aow_architecture.png
Architecture diagram showing the complete AOW system components and their interactions.

### temporal_binding_diagram.png
Visual explanation of the temporal binding concept and how it provides Byzantine resistance.

### event_chain_structure.png
Diagram illustrating the structure of AOW-based event chains and their cryptographic properties.

### stark_proof_flow.png

## 4. Usage Instructions

To use these assets:

1. **Parameters**: Copy the parameter files to your configuration directory
2. **Templates**: Use the templates as starting points for your own configurations
3. **Images**: Reference the images in documentation and presentations

Example usage:

```bash
# Copy parameters to config directory
cp assets/parameters/params_128.json config/

# Use template for custom configuration
cp assets/templates/config_template.json config/custom.json
# Edit config/custom.json with your settings

These assets provide a complete foundation for configuring, deploying, and understanding the AOW system, with parameter sets for different security levels and templates for various deployment scenarios.
produce all the images in this readme according to the manuscript I provided to you, in .md format
